Performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset loaded from a CSV file. 
It utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. 
The initial steps involve inspecting the datasetâ€™s structure, dimensions, column names, and basic statistics, followed by analyzing missing values. 
Data cleaning includes dropping irrelevant columns like STATE, ADDRESSLINE2, and PHONE to streamline the dataset. 
The notebook employs statistical summaries and transformations to prepare the data for deeper analysis. 
Visualization tools, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, are likely used to identify trends, distributions, and correlations. 
The overall objective is to uncover actionable insights and patterns from the sales data.
